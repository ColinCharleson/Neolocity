    more missions. Hurry up!
  missionMessage: We've received news of a patrol drone headed to the government
    tower. Follow it to locate the secret entrance. Once you find it, return here
    and I'll have the next phase of our plan ready.
  finishedMessage: Perfect! We have the intel. Now, it's your time to save the city.
    Enter the tower and disable the robot power generator. Be careful, as they'll
    have powerful security inside.
  keepGoingMessage: The patrol robot is on the move! Hurry up and follow it. We've
    set a GPS tracker on your compass to help you locate it!
  allDoneMessage: The last step is to take out the power generator. Good luck!
